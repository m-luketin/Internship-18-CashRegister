# Internship-18-CashRegister
The final dev internship project using ASP.NET

Navigate through the tabs using the SHIFT key, and the searches using the arrows + ENTER key.
Everything else is more or less clear. This project could have been done a lot better, but I ran out of time :(. 
Kinda tripped at the finish line here.

This was a very, very teaching and fulfilling experience. Not just the project but the entire dev internship, and I'm very happy to have been a part of it.
